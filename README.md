# Metal Detector Arduino Project

#### Project Overview

This project involves creating a simple metal detector using an Arduino. The system works by charging and discharging a capacitor and measuring the change in capacitance. The presence of a metal object changes the capacitance, which is detected and displayed via the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Board**
2. **Capacitor**
3. **Resistor**
4. **Jumper Wires**
5. **Breadboard**

### Block diagram


#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the capacitor to an analog pin on the Arduino.
   - Connect the other end of the capacitor to GND.
   - Connect a digital pin to the capacitor to control its charging and discharging.
   - Ensure proper connections for stable measurements.

2. **Initialize the System:**
   - Set the digital pin as an output to control the charging pulses.
   - Set the analog pin as an input to read the capacitor's charge.
   - Start serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 for data monitoring.

3. **Measure Capacitance:**
   - In the loop function, measure the charge and discharge cycles of the capacitor.
   - Collect and process multiple readings to get an accurate measure of capacitance.
   - Use a function to control the charging pulses.

4. **Detect Metal:**
   - Calculate the sum of the readings, removing any spikes by ignoring the minimum and maximum values.
   - Compare the sum with an expected average to detect significant changes in capacitance, indicating the presence of metal.
   - If the change is within a certain range, update the expected value; otherwise, count it as noise.

5. **Output Results:**
   - Print the sum, average sum, and difference to the Serial Monitor for real-time monitoring.
   - Adjust the system based on the feedback for accurate metal detection.

#### Applications

- **Metal Detection:** This setup can be used to detect the presence of metal objects in various environments.
- **Educational Projects:** Use this project to understand capacitance measurement and metal detection principles.
- **Interactive Projects:** Integrate metal detection in interactive or security-related projects.
